# Written-In-The-Stars
Storing information in the stars? Doable!

The main aim of this project was to bring the core principals of the Library of Babel upto a more pleasing level. While I was thinking how I was gonna do this, I had a epiphany - if all information <i>can</i> be conveyed through a medium that is limited in nature (language). Why not convey information as permutations of other patterns? Like stars for example. So that's where it all started! Here I've provided a .exe file to run the "game", so you can test things out yourself.

It works like this, information - *ahem* - ,<b>all information</b> has been stored in the form of stars. Both as star clusters and constellations. You can make your own contellations and find what they mean or search for a particular constellation by entering any text within these limits:

 - Text length is <= 3200 characters
 - Text only uses these characters. [a-z][, !.&:]
 
 Other than that, enjoy stargazing!
